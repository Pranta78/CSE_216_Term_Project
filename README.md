* You can create an account in **create-account** url
* I have handled the form data in an oracle procedure <code>CREATE_ACCOUNT</code>. You can find them in **procedure.txt**.
* Login is dealt in <code>LOGIN</code> procedure
* Login is supported in **login** url
* Profile photo and header photo haven't been handled yet. We'll probably have to store them in django file storage too.
* I have made a navbar in **home** page. It would be better if we render _news-feed_, _messages_, _notifications_ alongside the navbar, not mandatory though.
